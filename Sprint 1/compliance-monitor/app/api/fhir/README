# FHIR API Endpoints

## Overview

This directory contains REST endpoints that interface with the external FHIR server. These endpoints serve as the communication layer between our application and the FHIR data source.

## Current Implementation

Currently, our endpoints only know ID retrival, requiring we know the specific resource's ID. This is unrealistic, and just for testing and initial development.

```
GET /api/fhir/Patient/{id}
GET /api/fhir/MedicationStatement/{id}
```

## TODO 

Future implementation should:

- Search by patient identifier
- Filter by date ranges
- Query by medication type ???
- Bundle requests for related resources

## Usage

Example request:
```
GET /api/fhir/MedicationStatement/med-statement-123
```
