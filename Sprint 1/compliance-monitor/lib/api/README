# Client API Library

## Overview

This directory contains a collection of service classes that provide a simple interface for interacting with our relevant FHIR resources. These classes abstract away the complexity of FHIR resource manipulation and HTTP communication details.

## Purpose

The Client API library serves to:

1. Simplify CRUD operations on FHIR resources
2. Provide domain-specific methods that make sense for our application
3. Abstract away the technical details of the FHIR specification
4. Maintain consistent error handling and data validation

## Usage

Each service class corresponds to a specific FHIR resource type (e.g., `MedicationStatementService`, `PatientService`) and provides methods tailored to our application's needs.

Example:
```typescript
TDB
```

## Design Philosophy

Rather than working directly with raw FHIR resources, these services provide a more intuitive API that aligns with our application's requirements while mantaining the types.
